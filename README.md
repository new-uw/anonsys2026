# ARMOR <!-- omit from toc -->

## Supported Hardware and Software
Platform is the Orion O6, supports the Armv9-A SVE2 and its cryptographic extensionsm and the SVE2 vector length is 128 bits. Evaluation is built on liboqs 0.15.0, oqs-provider 0.10.0, and OpenSSL 3.5.0.

## PQC Test
1. cd aource_lib
2. mkdir build && cd build

## TLS Handshake Test

### Installation Instructions
1. cp -r source_lib ../ARMOR/tmp
2. bash ./setup.sh --use-local-sources
3. rm -rf ./test_data/alg_lists
4. cp -r ./source_lib/alg_lists ./test_data/alg_lists

### TLS Performance Testing
1. bash ./scripts/test_scripts/tls_generate_keys.sh
2. bash ./scripts/test_scripts/pqc_tls_performance_test.sh

### Testing Output Files
After the testing has been completed, unparsed results and automatically parsed results will be stored in the generated `test_data/` directory:

**Unparsed Results:** `test_data/up_results/`

**Parsed Results:** `test_data/results/`

### Project Clean
1. bash ./cleaner.sh

This project depends on the following third-party software and libraries:

1. **[Liboqs](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs)** – Used to provide standalone implementations of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature algorithms for computational performance testing.

2. **[OQS-Provider](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider)** – Used to integrate post-quantum algorithms from `Liboqs` into OpenSSL via the provider interface, enabling TLS-based performance testing. The provider is built locally and dynamically linked into OpenSSL. It is licensed under the MIT License.

4. **[PQC-LEO](https://github.com/crt26/PQC-LEO.git)** - PQC-LEO provides an automated and comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms. It is designed for researchers and developers looking to evaluate the feasibility of integrating PQC into their environments. The framework streamlines the setup and testing of PQC implementations, enabling the collection of computational and networking performance metrics across x86 and ARM systems through a suite of dedicated automation scripts.
